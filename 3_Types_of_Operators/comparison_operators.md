# Comparison Operators

Comparison operators are used to compare two values.It returns a boolean value, either true or false.

## Comparison operators includes:


/**
 * In some other programming languages, equality and inequality operators are == and !=. 
They also exist in JavaScript, but it’s safer to use === and !== instead.
 */


  
### - Equal to(==)

### What is Equal to(==) operator ?
    
  - The equal to(==) operator is used to compare two values.It returns true if the values are equal, otherwise it returns false.
  
  - Example:

console.log(10 == 10); // true
    
console.log(10 == 20); // false

console.log(10 == "10"); // true

console.log(10 == "20"); // false

console.log(10 == 20); // false

console.log(10 == 10); // true


### - Not equal or Inequality operator to(!=)

### what is Not equal to(!=) operator ?
      
  - The not equal to(!=) operator is used to compare two values.It returns true if the values are not equal, otherwise it returns false.
    
  - Example:



 * In some other programming languages, equality and inequality operators are == and !=. 
They also exist in JavaScript, but it’s safer to use === and !== instead.

  
### what is the difference between Equality == and Strict Equality === operators ?
      
  - == is used to compare two values, but it does not check the data type of the values.
      
*!  - == is used to compare two values, but it does not check the data type of the values.
*!  - == is called the equality operator.
 *!  - == returns true if the values are equal, otherwise it returns false.

 - === is used to compare two values, but it also checks the data type of the values.
*!  - === is used to compare two values, but it also checks the data type of the values
*!  - === is called the strict equality operator.
*!  - === returns true if the values are equal and have the same data type, otherwise it returns false. 
 


  - Greater than(>)

  - Greater than or equal to(>=)

  - Less than(<)

  - Less than or equal to(<=)

### - Strict equal to(===)
    
### what is Strict equal to(===) operator ?
      
  - The strict equal to(===) operator is used to compare two values.It returns true if the values are equal and have the same data type, otherwise it returns false.

###  - Strict not equal to(!==)
    
### what is Strict not equal to(!==) operator ?
      
  - The strict not equal to(!==) operator is used to compare two values.It returns true if the values are not equal or have different data types, otherwise it returns false.

### - Logical AND(&&)
    
### what is Logical AND(&&) operator ?
      
 - The logical AND(&&) operator is used to combine two or more conditions.It returns true if all the conditions are true, otherwise it returns false.

###  - Logical OR(||)
    
### what is Logical OR(||) operator ?
      
- The logical OR(||) operator is used to combine two or more conditions.It returns true if any of the conditions are true, otherwise it returns false.

### - Logical NOT(!)
    
### what is Logical NOT(!) operator ?
      
  - The logical NOT(!) operator is used to reverse the result of a condition.It returns true if the condition is false, and false if the condition is true.

### - Ternary operator(?: )
    
### what is Ternary operator(?: ) ?
      
  - The ternary operator(?: ) is used to assign a value to a variable based on a condition.It is a shorthand for the if-else statement.
  
### - typeof
    
### what is typeof operator ?
      
  - The typeof operator is used to get the data type of a value.It returns a string that represents the data type of the value.
    
    
    
### - instanceof
    
### what is instanceof operator ?
    
  - The instanceof operator is used to check if an object is an instance of a specific class or constructor function.It returns true if the object is an instance of the class, otherwise it returns false.
    
### - in
    
### what is in operator ?
    
  - The in operator is used to check if a property exists in an object or an element exists in an array.It returns true if the property or element exists, otherwise it returns false.
    
### - delete
    
### what is delete operator ?
    
  - The delete operator is used to delete a property from an object or an element from an array.It returns true if the property or element is deleted successfully, otherwise it returns false.
    
### - void
    
### what is void operator ?
    
- The void operator is used to evaluate an expression without returning a value.It returns undefined.
