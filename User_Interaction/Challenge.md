# Problem Statement Coding Challenge

## Explanation

Problem statement
Write a program that asks the user for his first name and last name. It then concatenates them and displays them in a single sentence.

Input
Prompt the user for his first and last name, letâ€™s say she entered the following:

## HTML Structure:

The HTML file is basic with a <!DOCTYPE html> declaration to ensure standards compliance.
The <head> contains the title and the embedded JavaScript code within <script> tags.
The <body> has an onload attribute to call the concatenateNames function when the page loads.
JavaScript Function (concatenateNames):

Uses prompt to ask the user for their first and last names.
Concatenates the first name and last name with a space in between.
Uses alert to display a message with the concatenated names.
How to Run the Code
Copy the entire code above and save it in a file named index.html.
Open the index.html file in a web browser.
The browser will prompt you to enter the first name and last name, then display the concatenated result in an alert box.
This simple example demonstrates the basic input/output operations in JavaScript using prompt and alert functions.
