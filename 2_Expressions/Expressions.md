Expressions in Javascript and how to use them in JavaScript.

An expression is a piece of code that produces a value. An expression is created by combining variables, values and operators. Every expression has a value and thus a type. Calculating an expressionâ€™s value is called evaluation. During evaluation, variables are replaced by their values.
