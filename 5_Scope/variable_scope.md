# Scope Variable

The scope of a variable is the part of the program where the variable is visible and usable

## Blocked Scoped

Variables declared with let or const are block-scoped: their visibility is limited to the block where they are declared (and every sub-block, if any)

In JavaScript and many other programming languages, a code block is a portion of a program delimited by a pair of opening and closing braces. By default, a JavaScript program forms one block of code
